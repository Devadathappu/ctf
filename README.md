# 🛡️ Capture The Flag (CTF) Platform – March 2025

A custom-built **Capture The Flag (CTF) platform** designed to help learners and SOC teams practice web application exploitation and detection in a safe, controlled environment.  

## 🚀 Overview
This project is a fully functional **CTF environment** featuring 8+ vulnerable labs that cover a variety of common security issues.  
It is ideal for students, cybersecurity enthusiasts, and SOC analysts looking for hands-on, real-world practice.

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- **Backend:** PHP, MySQL  
- **Platform:** Linux (Parrot OS)  
- **Focus Areas:** Web Security, SOC Training, Vulnerability Simulation  

## 🎯 Key Features
- 🔓 **Vulnerable Labs** – Includes SQL Injection, XSS, Command Injection, and Misconfigured Services  
- 🎮 **Gamified Environment** – Points-based challenges for interactive learning  
- 🏹 **Attack Simulation** – Realistic exploitation scenarios for end-to-end practice  
- 🛡 **SOC Training Integration** – Supports log analysis and detection workflows  

## 🧪 Example Vulnerabilities
- **SQLi:** Extract sensitive data via vulnerable parameters  
- **XSS:** Craft payloads to execute malicious scripts  
- **Command Injection:** Gain command execution on the server  
- **Service Misconfigurations:** Exploit weak configurations and gain deeper access
