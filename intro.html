        <h1>The Shadow Syndicate</h1>
        <p>In the depths of the dark web, a notorious hacking group, known only as <strong>Shadow Syndicate</strong>, has launched a silent cyber-assault on a major online platform. Their methods are elusive, their traces nearly invisible. But there's one flaw—they always leave a clue.</p>
        
        <p>Your mission is to step into the shoes of a digital detective, a white-hat hacker determined to uncover the vulnerabilities before real damage is done.</p>
        
        <h2>The Clues</h2>
        <p>Rumors suggest that certain file extensions are not properly validated. Can a simple case-change slip past the security measures?</p>
        <p>Whispers from the underground say that a cleverly crafted command might just reveal what lies at the root.</p>
        <p>A ghost in the system claims that authentication is an illusion. Perhaps a single query holds the key to gaining access?</p>
        <p>Identifiers should be unique, yet a minor tweak reveals another's secrets. But what if those identifiers aren’t as random as they seem?</p>
        <p>Messages on the black market speak of malicious scripts lurking in the shadows. Some are reflected instantly; others are stored, waiting for the perfect moment to strike.</p>
        <p>A hidden API is said to hold a crucial piece of the puzzle. The flag may be right in front of you—wrapped within familiar brackets.</p>
        
        <h2>The Challenge</h2>
        <p>To bring down the Shadow Syndicate, you must uncover their attack vectors. Can you crack the vulnerabilities, expose their exploits, and retrieve the ultimate flag?</p>
